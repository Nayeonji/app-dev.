# *The Amazing Spiderman (2012)*

## *Directed by: 	Marc Webb*

### **This is my favorite movie of Spiderman not because im being biased, It's just the story of this hits different than the other spiderman movies and also the cgi of this movie is just that very cool, specially when he swings around through buildings in stuffs and the fighting scenes this also had his comedys. I've watch some of the spiderman movies specially the new ones but this movie still hits different than the others and since i idolized andrew that much and i consider him as the best spiderman actor throughout his multiverse in the marvel**
